# Ad_Click_Predictor
This project is aimed to train a prediction model to forecast the click-through rate for advertisements.  The system will be implemented to predict the CTRs of potential users, which in turn will recommend the suggested targeting users based on the CTR predicted and the ideal CTR threshold.
